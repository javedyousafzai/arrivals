<p>Since the beginning of 2015, over 1.3 million of refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe, a huge majority arriving via the Mediterranean. The volume of refugee and migrant flows reached unprecedented levels, impacting the capacity of countries to cope with the movement. Although the pressures faced by particular countries have varied considerably. Still, faced with domestic pressure, several States have unilaterally reinforced measures to limit access to territory, through both legal and extra-legal methods, which affect persons in need of international protection as much as irregular migrants, and increase their exposure to protection risks considerably.</p>
<p>UNHCR Offices in Europe are collecting a great deal of valuable information &ndash; however, the use of this data to monitor and compare trends and/or country situations at a specific point in time, to feed advocacy initiatives, and to support the design of protection strategies is hampered by the lack of harmonization among countries of scope, tools and methodologies for data collection.</p>
